The template relies on the following packages:
 * hyperref: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/hyperref/
 * caption: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/
 * url: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/url/
 * titlesec: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/titlesec/
 * footmisc: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/footmisc/
 * bibspacing: http://dcwww.camd.dtu.dk/~schiotz/comp/LatexTips/bibspacing.sty
 * balance: http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=balance

Note that excepting bibspacing and balance, any modern LaTeX system should 
include the rest of packages.

Updates:

[Jul 15, 2011] Hyperref colors.
Colors for citations, URLs, and cross-references were set on purpose to remark 
that they can be clickable (navigable). At present they are set to blue.
Of course you can set them to whatever color; e.g., set the hyperref options 
'citecolor=black, linkcolor=black, urlcolor=black'; or even 'colorlinks=false'
to display a bounding box instead. There are two ways of changing this behavior:
 1. In your LaTeX file. Just type in the preamble:
 \hypersetup{citecolor=black,linkcolor=black,urlcolor=black}
 2. Editing the template: see lines 190--192 of chi-ext.cls.

[Dec 9, 2011] Bibliography styles.
Previously, references in the examples were formated by using the (standard) 
abbrv BST style. Now the ACM Transactions bibliography style is used instead, as
in the MS Word CHI Archival and EA templates.

[Feb 13, 2012] Added compatibility with the archival template (\toappear and 
\confname commands).

[Jul 12, 2012] Files moved to the sigchi-latex Google code repository:
